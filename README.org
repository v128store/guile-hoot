* What is this?

[[file:./hoot.png]]

This repo is for updates to "Hoot" (or "Guile Hoot"), the codename for
the [[https://spritely.institute/news/guile-on-web-assembly-project-underway.html][Guile->WebAssembly project]] launched by the [[https://spritely.institute/][Spritely Institute]].
As work on Hoot progresses, updates will be posted here!

Hoot is being developed in [[https://gitlab.com/spritely/guile][Spritely's Guile development branches]]
(which is where code-related issues and PRs should go, btw).
This repository is for tracking history and design decisions
as the project progresses.

* Current status

Currently Hoot is in very early, very experimental stages.
The goal is to either:

 - Have all of the Hoot related branches make it upstream to Guile
   proper
 - Or, have Hoot be a separate (possibly renamed?) library eventually,
   but still resulting in necessary changes to Guile being properly
   upstreamed

* But... why the name "Hoot"?

We thought this project deserved a cute project name and mascot, and
everyone at the time agreed an owl was nice, and Christine
Lemmer-Webber had recently just drawn up this owl pixel art, and
so it became the mascot.
The name naturally flowed from there.
