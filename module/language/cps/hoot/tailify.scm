;;; Commentary:

;;; Tailification converts a program so that all calls are tail calls.
;;; It is a minimal form of global CPS conversion that stack-allocates
;;; "return continuations" -- minimal in the sense that the only
;;; additionally residualized continuations are the ones necessary to
;;; preserve the all-tail-calls property.  Notably, loops, conditionals,
;;; and similar features in the source program are left as is unless
;;; it's necessary to split them.
;;;
;;; The first step of tailification computes the set of "tails" in a
;;; function.  The function entry starts a tail, as does each return
;;; point from non-tail calls.  Join points between different tails
;;; also start tails.
;;;
;;; In the residual program, there are four ways that a continuation
;;; exits:
;;;
;;;   - Tail calls in the source program are tail calls in the residual
;;;     program; no change.
;;;
;;;   - For non-tail calls in the source program, the caller saves the
;;;     state of the continuation (the live variables flowing into the
;;;     continuation) on an explicit stack, and saves the label of the
;;;     continuation.  The return continuation will be converted into a
;;;     arity-checking function entry, to handle multi-value returns;
;;;     when it is invoked, it will pop its incoming live variables from
;;;     the continuation stack.
;;;
;;;   - Terms that continue to a join continuation are converted to
;;;     label calls in tail position, passing the state of the
;;;     continuation as arguments.
;;;
;;;   - Returning values from a continuation pops the return label from
;;;     the stack and does an indirect tail label call on that label,
;;;     with the given return values.
;;;
;;; Additionally, the abort-to-prompt run-time routine may unwind the
;;; explicit stack and tail-call a handler continuation.  If the
;;; continuation is not escape-only, then the slice of the continuation
;;; that would be popped off is captured before unwinding.  Resuming a
;;; continuation splats the saved continuation back on the stack and
;;; returns to the top continuation, just as in the tail return case
;;; above.
;;;
;;; We expect that a tailified program will probably be slower than a
;;; non-tailified program.  However a tailified program has a few
;;; interesting properties: the stack is packed and only contains live
;;; data; the stack can be traversed in a portable way, allowing for
;;; implementation of prompts on systems that don't support them
;;; natively; and as all calls are tail calls, the whole system can be
;;; implemented naturally with a driver trampoline on targets that don't
;;; support tail calls (e.g. JavaScript and WebAssembly).
