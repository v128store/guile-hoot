* What is this?

[[file:./hoot.png]]

This repo is for updates to "Hoot" (or "Guile Hoot"), the codename for
the [[https://spritely.institute/news/guile-on-web-assembly-project-underway.html][Guile->WebAssembly project]] launched by the [[https://spritely.institute/][Spritely Institute]].
As work on Hoot progresses, updates will be posted here!

* But... why the name "Hoot"?

We thought this project deserved a cute project name and mascot, and
everyone at the time agreed an owl was nice, and Christine
Lemmer-Webber had recently just drawn up this owl pixel art, and
so it became the mascot.
The name naturally flowed from there.
